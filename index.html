			<h1>P!nk - "Try"</h1>
			<p>
				Ever wonder about what he’s doing 
				<br> 
				How it all turned to lies
				<br>
				Sometimes I think that it’s better
				<br> 
				To never ask why
			</p>
			<p>
				Where there is desire 
				<br>
				There is gonna be a flame
				<br>
				Where there is a flame 
				<br>
				Someone’s bound to get burned
				<br>
				But just because it burns 
				<br>
				Doesn’t mean you’re gonna die
				<br>
				You gotta get up and try and try and try
				<br>
				Gotta get up and try and try and try
				<br>
				Gotta get up and try and try and try
			</p>
			<p>
				Funny how the heart can be deceiving
				<br>
				More than just a couple times
				<br>
				Why do we fall in love so easy
				<br>
				Even when it’s not right?
